# Machine learning algorithms for predicting default of Credit Card clients ðŸ’³

Classification of default of credit card clients from the UCI dataset using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The aim of this study is to exploit some supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the key drivers that determine the likelihood of credit card default, underlining the mathematical aspects behind the methods used. Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments. In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, the overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and debts

The goal is to build an automated model for both identifying the key factors, and predicting a credit card default based on the information about the client and historical transactions. The general concepts of the supervised machine learning paradigm are later reported, together with a detailed explanation of all techniques and algorithms used to build the models.

### Environment

The analysis has been fully conducted with Python language, exploiting several machine learning and statistical frameworks available such as `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `imblearn` together with other data visualization libraries (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`).
